FAIL
Kernel panic in run: PANIC at ../../devices/disk.c:436 in select_sector(): assertion `sec_no < d->capacity' failed.
Call stack: 0xc0106ad2
Translation of call stack:
0xc0106ad2: debug_panic (.../../lib/kernel/debug.c:34)

This assertion commonly fails when accessing a file via an inode that
has been closed and freed.  Freeing an inode clears all its sector
indexes to 0xcccccccc, which is not a valid sector number for disks
smaller than about 1.6 TB.
